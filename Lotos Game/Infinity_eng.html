                Project "Infinity" is a 3D first-person shooter in which you have to fight for one of three factions. 
                The game takes place in 2050 in the country of Lirat. It all started a year ago, when the Lirat government
                began to interfere with the activities of the Eternity organization. There were minor skirmishes between government 
                and Eternity mercenaries. However, the parties wanted to prevent a war, but the third party to the conflict
                (hired by an organization competing with Eternity) did not allow the conflict to stabilize. Thus began the Lirat Civil War.
