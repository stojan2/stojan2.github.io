                We are the Lotos Game team, and our goal is to convince everyone that anything can be done.
                Our project was created on September 4, 2023. We develop video games using the easiest programming
                language: Python. On this site you can see all our projects and support us with a donation.

                I am the creator of LotosGame. In this studio I work as a programmer, designer and 3D modeler. 
                I started my career as a programmer with a regular 2D platformer and the first bot in Discord. I will be very glad if you like my projects!

                Hi, I'm Deleted. I'm originally from the Russian Federation. I work at Lotos Game. My job is to develop the lore component of projects and come up with different modes.
                You could see the results of my work in the game Project "Infinity". Specifically in this project,
                I was involved in describing guns, describing maps, balancing the forces in the modes,
                balancing the game's weapons, describing bosses. It is also thanks to me that the weapons in the game have such a name.
                I hope that you liked this aspect of the game.
                If you have the desire and opportunity, then support our projects with a donation. I will be
                grateful!

                I am the creator of this site and many other projects. I have been developing various projects for 5 years (Games/Engine/Bots/Websites).
                I want to create a project for the gaming industry and its audience that would be a social utopia in a cruel world.
